        Instance name: mayank.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
        Check if listening on port 22:
                    telnet mayank.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com 22
                    Telnet was disabled so had to enable it from

    Attempt 2
        Change to root and execute "npm install"
        sudo su
        /opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v6.14.3-linux-x64/bin/node /opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v6.14.3-linux-x64/bin/npm install

        Before it got stuck on some parallel processing issue. Lets see if it succeeds today.

        It got stuck again on following code:
            extract:fb: sill gunzTarPerm extractEntry lib/scope/lib/renamer.js

            Seems I need to do it with yarn and install it during app setup.

    Attempt 3
        Install yarn with .ebextensions yaml file.
        Use the yarn to install node packages.

        Installed yarn on windows and it works.

        Manually install yarn:
            curl --silent --location https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
        Run yarn command on root

        Tried to login again; 
            eb ssh Helloworld02-env --region us-west-2
        but stuck on :
            INFO: Running ssh -i C:\Users\mayank1568\.ssh\aws-eb ec2-user@54.244.135.103

        Tried with putty giving credentials ppk file:
            It hangs, ideally it should ask for user.

        Tried recreating the environment, may take several minutes.
            Closed the hanged window.
            Executed above two commands:
                    eb ssh --setup Helloworld02-env --region us-west-2
                    eb ssh Helloworld02-env --region us-west-2
        Login successful

        Node was not available to root for yarn installation 
        sudo su
        curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -
        sudo yum install -y nodejs
        curl --silent --location https://dl.yarnpkg.com/rpm/yarn.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/yarn.repo
        sudo yum install yarn

        Now yarn works

        Did a yarn on project root.

        Node modules have data now.
        
        change owner of all modules recursively to nodejs
        chown -R nodejs:nodejs node_modules
        Verified all modules roles updated.
        Restarting the app server.

        Now complained about Cannot find module '../../../credentials.json'
        Added file manually 
        and did npm run build
        /opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v6.14.3-linux-x64/bin/node /opt/elasticbeanstalk/node-install/node-v6.14.3-linux-x64/bin/npm run build

        successful
        chown -R nodejs:nodejs .

        server restart from console

        App launched, Hurray

        Database tables are gone.
            Database connectivity not working
            Created another database and could successfully connect through pgAdmin

        Seems need to fix security groups or vpc.
        5wordsdaily.live also givine 503 even though node is showing the app.

            Added a security group and it started working. <troubleshooting/DBPublicAccessIssue.PNG>

    Resolved
        Hardcoded the database path for the restored database into deployed code on instance.
        Installed yarn manually on the instance and installed node_modules with it. npm install was hanging all the time.


Issue: Even though application working on node but not on domain
    Check the loadbalance url. 5wordsdaily-1122278580.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
        Loadbalance giving : 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
    So this needs to be fixed.
        Found that target groups were empty:
            troubleshooting/targetGroupsNoEntry.png

        Added them and application started working.
            troubleshooting/targetGroupsModifiedAndApplicationWorking.PNG
    
    
        database backup done: backup_22_aug_2018_db_postgres.bak
        by default it goes to documents table
        
Issue:
    Can't delete eb environment as backend databases are deleted manually.

    Resolution:
